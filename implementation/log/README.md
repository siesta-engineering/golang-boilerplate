# `Log`

Logging in Go serves the purpose or recording or printing messages to a log service or specific output. Logging has several important functions in software development, including.

- Troubleshooting

  Logging allows developer to records events and additional information while program is running. This help developer in troubleshooting and solving issues when application is in production environment.

- Performance analysis

  Logging allows developer to records performance or related information. Such as the time taken to execute a specific function or operation. This help developer to identifying areas that can can be optimized.

- Audit and Security

  Logging can be used to records security or related events or activities for audit purposes. This can including user access, configuration changes, or other security critical activities.

- Monitoring

  In production environment, logging is important part of monitoring system. The recorded information helps in understanding the overall health and performance of the system.

- Facilitating Maintenance

  Logs also provide insight during development process, helping developers to understand the program excution flow and capturing information along the way. This help developers for maintenance and ongoing development.

## Implementation

- Current

  Currently the Go application in SIESTA has implemented log, but in my personal opinion is not very efficient, because the developer needs to write which layer this code executed every time it logs and wherre this error occurs.

  Several weakness in current implementation of logs in SIESTA:

  1. The current log implementation cannot be used to monitor the execution time of each operation.
  2. Doesn't tell the developer the specific part of the code where the error occured. Developers needs to track the error manually by messages
  3. Cannot track errors on specific clients, whis will make difficult for developers to handle problems with specific operations if the application is being accessed by many clients.

  There following is an example of the log that siesta currently implements
